# Classic Adventure

_Minecraft_'s modern Adventure Mode is effectively Survival Mode but with the inability to break blocks. This mode is useful for mapmakers who wish to keep their creations unsullied by players, limiting world modification to specific instances using the `CanPlaceOn` and `CanDestroy` tags.

However, before release 1.8, Adventure Mode was different: block breaking was instead limited to the correct tool type. The mode adds just the slightest challenge to the usual survival experience, particularly at the start. And, in contrast to modern Adventure Mode, the game is actually playable[^1].

The Classic Adventure mod restores Adventure Mode to its former glory while also implementing a few obvious adjustments. The mod is faithful to [this list](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Adventure/Before_1.8) of tools and the blocks they can destroy, with an exception made for leaves and axes. The mod also adds a flint axe, which can be obtained without any other tools at the start of the game. 

[^1]: Not that you _can't_ play it; resources and tools can be garnered from loot chests.
